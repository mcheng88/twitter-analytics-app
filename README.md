 twitter-analytics-app
Building a Twitter Analytics App with Python. 

Goals: 
- Working on improving Python skils
- Getting more used to Git with the command line
- Messing around with Linux

Thoughts on basic functionality:
- Tracking trending tweets
- Tracking based on location - NYC or USA. 


Moving further from the original idea, due to some ideas stemmed from the clout of Caleb Jo:

I will potentially be restarting this project in a bit.
