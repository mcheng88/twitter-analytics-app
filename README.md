# twitter-analytics-app
Building a Twitter Analytics App with Python. 

#### Thoughts on basic functionality:
- Tracking trending tweets
- Tracking based on location - NYC or USA. 


Moving further from the original idea, due to some ideas stemmed from the clout of Caleb Jo:
- http://www.bharathsrivatsan.com/files/tweets.pdf
- https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3a29/da8379a5069fa569361684b9eea752bca7cb.pdf

- https://github.com/hunkim/word-rnn-tensorflow
- https://medium.com/mlreview/a-simple-deep-learning-model-for-stock-price-prediction-using-tensorflow-30505541d877

I will potentially be restarting this project in a bit. \[8-15-18]: Definitely restarting this once back in NYC. 

### What if you could track trends before they became trends? 
The ability to capitalize off of social media would be actually automated from here on out. 

This project will be a deep dive into the world of analytics and trend prediction. 

I'll be starting off without using AI, and if there is a potential in that field, I will jump into it.

First off though, I'll be building code based off the first two papers linked above. 

ToDo:
- Restructure Repo
- Build basic scripts based on papers
- Build basic UI to communicate information
